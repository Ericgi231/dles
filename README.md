# The Dles

"They call them the dles but they are anything but." - Northernlion

The dles is a curated collection of 300+ daily web games. A "dle" is generally a game that changes everyday which has the same version for everyone that plays, often taking inspiration from [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle). Dles are free and do not require a login or subscription.

View the app [here](https://aukspot.github.io/dles/) or view the list in a markdown table at the [bottom of this README](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#current-list-of-dles).

## Contributing

The easiest way to help the project is to suggest new dles by either filling out [this form](https://aukspot.github.io/dles/suggest) or [opening a "dle suggestion" issue](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dles+suggestion&projects=&template=suggest-a-dle-.md&title=Dle+suggestion).

If you'd like to make changes directly, you can edit [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json) and do one of three things:

1. Add a new dle: copy and paste an existing dle in [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json) and then change the information to that of the new dle. It's okay if its tags are empty, but make sure all of the other fields are filled appropriately.
2. Remove a dle (if there's a broken link): delete the dle from [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json).
3. Fix a dle (if there's a typo, broken link): Open [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json), find the dle you'd like to fix, and make the changes you'd like to make.

## Features

You can suggest a feature by [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### Current

- A list of over 300 curated dles.
- Ten categories to help with organization.
- Randomly choose and open a dle from selected categories.

### Planned

- Option to hide/show given dles.
- URL parameters:
  - to load a "playlist", an exact list of dles. (each dle must be in [dles.json](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/blob/main/src/lib/data/dles.json))

## Bugs

If you run into a bug, please [submit a bug report](https://github.com/aukspot/dles/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

### Development

The app is written in Svelte with SvelteKit. You will need to have `npm` installed.

To get started, clone the repository and go into the project's folder.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start development server

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

#### Building

When you're ready to create a production version of the project, run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will update the `./docs` directory with a new build of the site.
